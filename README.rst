Normalizr is a Python library for text normalization that offers a bunch of actions to manipulate your text as much as you want. With normalizr you can replace symbols, punctuation, remove stop words and much more.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install the latest version is by using pip to pull it
from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/normalizr>`_:

::

    pip install normalizr

You may also use Git to clone the repository from Github and install it
manually:

::

    git clone https://github.com/davidmogar/normalizr.git
    cd normalizr
    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

        Note: Unicode strings are required. In case of using a Python version prior to 3.0, append a ``u`` before the text.

The next code shows a sample usage of this library:

.. code:: python

    from normalizr import Normalizr

    normalizr = Normalizr(language='en')
    print(normalizr.normalize('Who let the dog out?'))

Output:

.. code::

    let dog


It's also possible to send a list of normalizations to apply, which will be executed in order.

.. code:: python

    from normalizr import Normalizr

    normalizr = Normalizr(language='en')

    normalizations = [
        'remove_extra_whitespaces',
        ('replace_punctuation', {'replacement': ' '})
    ]

    print(normalizr.normalize('Who    let   the dog out?', normalizations))

Output:

.. code::

    Who let the dog out

If you only need to apply one normalization, use one of these methods:

-  remove_accent_marks
-  remove_extra_whitespaces
-  remove_stop_words
-  replace_emojis
-  replace_hyphens
-  replace_punctuation
-  replace_symbols
-  replace_urls
